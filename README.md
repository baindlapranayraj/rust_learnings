### 1. Getting Started

- Learned about basic syntax, `cargo` for project management, and building a simple "Hello, world!" program.
- Explored variables, functions, control flow, and data types.

### 2. Ownership and Borrowing

- Covered the core concept of **ownership**, which is unique to Rust.
- **Borrowing** and **references** taught how to share data between functions without copying it.
- **Slices** provide a way to reference part of a collection.

### 3. Structs and Enums

- **Structs** are custom data types that allow grouping related data.
- **Enums** enable defining a type by enumerating its possible variants.
- Still refining my understanding of Enums, especially with more complex data types.

### 4. Error Handling

- Learned about `Result` and `Option` for handling recoverable and non-recoverable errors.
- Used pattern matching with `match` and `unwrap` for concise error handling.

### 5. Collections

- Explored **vectors**, **strings**, and **hash maps**.
- Learned how to store and manipulate data in dynamic collections.

### 6. Traits and Generics

- Understood the concept of **traits** for defining shared behavior across types.
- Implemented **generic functions** and **trait bounds** to write flexible and reusable code.

### 7. Modules and Crates

- Explored Rust’s module system and how to organize code using **modules** and **crates**.
- Learned about visibility with `pub` and how to structure large projects.

### 8. Concurrency

- Covered Rust’s approach to concurrency using **threads**, **channels**, and **shared state**.
- Learned how Rust enforces safety in concurrent programs using ownership and borrowing rules.

### 9. Project Organization

- Learned about creating libraries, documenting code, and testing in Rust.
- Used `cargo doc` to generate documentation for projects.

### 10. Memory Management

- Explored how Rust handles memory through its **ownership model**.
- Understood stack vs. heap allocation, and how Rust achieves memory safety without a garbage collector.

## Conclusion

Rust has provided a deep understanding of systems programming, memory management, and safety without sacrificing performance. I am continuing to explore advanced topics and working on real-world projects.

Feel free to explore the repository and my notes from each chapter!
