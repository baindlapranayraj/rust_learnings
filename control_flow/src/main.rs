//- Blocks of code associated with the conditions in if expressions are sometimes called ğŸ¦€ arms.

//-In rust the condition in this code must be a bool. If the condition isnâ€™t a bool, 
// weâ€™ll get an error unlike in js if write a string or any integer it is considered as true 
// but it throws erro in rust
