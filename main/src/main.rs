//  1) Rust is a Systems programming language &Rust is a statically typed language, 
//     which means It is intended to be used
//    (but not restricted to) to do lower level things
//    -Building a Compiler
//    -Building a browser
//    -Working closer to the OS/kernel
//   Rust has built-in support for concurrent programming allowing multiple threads to perform
//   tasks simultaneously without risking data races
//   Rust has a concept of owners, borrowing and lifetimes that make it extremely memory safe

//  2)Unlike dynamic language, such as Ruby, Python, or JavaScript rust has two steps of runnig the Code,Like in JS we have
//    install NodeJS in our terminal inorder to run your program buttt in RustCompiling and runing are two seperate steps,
//    Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the
//    executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed.
